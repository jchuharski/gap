  <Abstract>
    The &XMod; package provides functions for computation with
<List>
  <Item>
  finite crossed modules of groups and cat1-groups, 
  and morphisms of these structures; 
  </Item>
  <Item>
  finite pre-crossed modules, pre-cat1-groups,   and their Peiffer quotients;
  </Item>
  <Item>
  isoclinism classes of groups and crossed modules; 
  </Item>
  <Item>
  derivations of crossed modules and sections of cat1-groups; 
  </Item>
  <Item>
  crossed squares and their morphisms,   including the actor crossed square of a crossed module; 
  </Item>
  <Item>
  crossed modules of finite groupoids (experimental version). 
  </Item>
</List>
<P/>
&XMod; was originally implemented in 1996 using the &GAP;3 language, when the second author was studying for a Ph.D. <Cite Key='A1'/> at Bangor.
<P/>
In April 2002 the first and third parts were converted to &GAP;4, the pre-structures were added, and version 2.001 was released. 
The final two parts, covering derivations, sections and actors, were included in the January 2004 release 2.002 for &GAP; 4.4.
<P/>
In October 2015 functions for computing isoclinism classes of crossed modules, written by Alper Odaba&#x15f; and Enver Uslu, were added.
These are contained in Chapter <Ref Chap='chap-isclnc' />, and are described in detail in the paper <Cite Key='IOU1' />.
<P/>
Bug reports, suggestions and comments are, of course, welcome. Please submit an issue at <URL>https://github.com/gap-packages/xmod/issues/</URL> or send an email to the first author at <Email>c.d.wensley@bangor.ac.uk</Email>.
