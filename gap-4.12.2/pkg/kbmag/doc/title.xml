  <Abstract>
    The &KBMAG; package is a &GAP; interface to some `C' programs for running the Knuth-Bendix completion program on finite semigroup, monoid or group presentations, and for attempting to compute  automatic structures of finitely presented groups.<P/>Bug reports, comments, suggestions for additional features, and offers to implement some of these, will all be very welcome.<P/>Please submit any issues at <URL>https://github.com/gap-packages/kbmag/issues/</URL>.<P/>
