  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YWhat is the goal of the ToricVarieties package?[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[13XToricVarieties[113X  provides  data structures to handle toric varieties by their
  commutative algebra structure and by their combinatorics. For combinatorics,
  it  uses  the [13XConvex[113X package. Its goal is to provide a suitable framework to
  work  with  toric  varieties. All combinatorial structures mentioned in this
  manual are the ones from [13XConvex[113X.[133X
