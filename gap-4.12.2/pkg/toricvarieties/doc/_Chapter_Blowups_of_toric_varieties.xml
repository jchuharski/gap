 <Description>
 The arguments are a toric variety vari, a string s which specifies the locus to be blown up and
 a string which specifies how to name the new blowup coordinate. Based on this,
 this method creates the blowup of a toric variety. This process rests on a star sub-division
 of the fan (c.f. 3.3.17 in Cox-Little-Schenk)

 <Description>
 The arguments are a toric variety vari and a list of lists. Each entry of this list must
 contain the information for one blowup, i.e. be made up of the two lists used as input for
