<P/>
<Emph>ToricVarieties</Emph> provides data structures to handle toric varieties by their commutative algebra structure and by their
combinatorics. For combinatorics, it uses the <Emph>Convex</Emph> package. Its goal is to provide a suitable framework to work with
toric varieties. All combinatorial structures mentioned in this manual are the ones from <Emph>Convex</Emph>.
