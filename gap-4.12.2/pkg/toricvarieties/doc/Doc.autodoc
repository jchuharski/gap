@Chapter Introduction

@Section What is the goal of the ToricVarieties package?


**ToricVarieties** provides data structures to handle toric varieties by their commutative algebra structure and by their
combinatorics. For combinatorics, it uses the **Convex** package. Its goal is to provide a suitable framework to work with
toric varieties. All combinatorial structures mentioned in this manual are the ones from **Convex**.

@Chapter Installation of the ToricVarieties Package

* To install this package just extract the package's archive file to the GAP pkg directory.
* By default the **ToricVarieties** package is not automatically loaded by **GAP** when it is installed.
  You must load the package with the following command, before its functions become avaiable:
  **LoadPackage( "ToricVarieties" );**
* Please, send me an e-mail if you have any questions, remarks, suggestions, etc. concerning this package.
  Also, I would be please to hear about applications of this package and about any suggestions for new methods
  to add to the package.
