  <Abstract>
    The LOOPS package provides researchers in nonassociative algebra with a computational tool that integrates standard notions of loop theory with libraries of loops and group-theoretical algorithms of GAP. The package also expands GAP toward nonassociative structures.

    We thank the following people for sending us remarks and comments, and
for suggesting new functionality of the package: Muniru Asiru, Bjoern
Assmann, Andreas Distler, Ale&#353; Dr&#225;pal, Graham Ellis, Steve
Flammia, Kenneth W. Johnson, Michael K. Kinyon, Olexandr Konovalov,

<P/>The library of Moufang loops of order 243 was generated from data
provided by Michael C. Slattery and Ashley L. Zenisek. The library of
right conjugacy closed loops of order less than 28 was generated from
data provided by Katharina Artic. The library of right Bruck loops of
order 27, 81 was obtained jointly with Izabella Stuhl.
