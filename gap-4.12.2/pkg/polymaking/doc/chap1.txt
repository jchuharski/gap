  [33X[0;0YTo  install  the package, just unpack it in your packages directory (usually
  [10X~/gap/pkg[110X  for  local  installation).  To use [5Xpolymaking[105X, you need a working
  installation  of  the program polymake [7Xhttps://polymake.org[107X. The package has
  been tested on linux and Mac OS X (10.4, 10.5 and 10.6). But it should be as
  platform independent as [5XGAP[105X and polymake.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  interaction  with  polymake is restricted to writing files and carrying
  out simple operations. These looked like[133X

  [33X[0;0Yon  the  command  line  for  polymake  versions  before  4. The keywords are
  polymake  methods  without arguments. Since polymake no longer supports this
  interface the polymaking package provides the script [10Xlib/pm_script_arg.pl[110X to
  emulate this.[133X

  [33X[0;0YUsing custom scripts is not supported.[133X
  [33X[0;0YEvery  call  to  polymake  will  re-start  the  program  anew.  This  causes
  considerable overhead. The number of calls to polymake is reduced by caching
  the results in the so-called [9XPolymakeObject[109X in GAP. As of polymaking version
  0.8.0,  old  versions  of  polymake  (i.e.  versions  before  2.7.9) are not
  supported anymore.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YA few words about the installation of polymake[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5Xpolymaking[105X  will  try  to  guess  the location of polymake. If this fails, a
  warning is issued at load time ([9XInfoWarning[109X level 1). Note that the guessing
  procedure  is  suppressed when [2XPOLYMAKE_COMMAND[102X ([14X3.2-1[114X) is set manually (see
  [14X1.2-3[114X).[133X
  [33X[0;0Y[10Xsetenv PATH ${PATH}:<your polymakepath>[110X[133X
  [33X[0;0YThe  general  rule  is:  If  [5Xpolymaking[105X  finds  polymake by itself, there is
  nothing to worry about.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YSetting variables for external programs[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs [5Xpolymaking[105X uses the program polymake, it needs to know where this program
  lives. The communication with polymake is done by writing files for polymake
  and  reading  its output (as returned to standard output "the prompt"). Note
  that the interface does not read any polymake file.[133X

  [33X[0;0YSets  the  directory  in  which  all  polymake files are created to [3Xdir[103X. The
  standard  place  for these files is a temporary directory generated when the
