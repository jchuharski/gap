  <Func Arg="G,T" Name="ShapesOfMajoranaRepresentation" />
 <Returns>a record with a component <A>shapes</A>
</Returns>
 <Description>
Takes a group <A>G</A> and a <A>G</A>-invariant set of generating involutions
 <A>T</A>. Returns a list of possible shapes of a Majorana Representation of the form
 <A>(G,T,V)</A> that is stored in the <A>shapes</A> component of the output.

<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="G,T" Name="ShapesOfMajoranaRepresentationAxiomM8" />
 <Returns>a record with a component <A>shapes</A>
</Returns>
 <Description>
Performs exactly the same function as <Ref Func="ShapesOfMajoranaRepresentation"/>
 but gives only those shapes at obey axiom M8. That is to say, we additionally assume
 that if <Math>t,s \in T</Math> such that <Math>|ts| = 2</Math> then the dihedral subalgebra <Math>\langle \langle a_t, a_s \rangle \rangle</Math>
 is of type <Math>2A</Math> if and only if <Math>ts \in T</Math> (and otherwise is of type <Math>2B</Math>).

<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="G,T" Name="MAJORANA_IsSixTranspositionGroup" />
 <Returns>true if <A>(G,T)</A> is a 6-transposition group, otherwise returns false
</Returns>
 <Description>
For a group <A>G</A> and a subset <A>T</A> of <A>G</A>, returns true
 if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
 *<A>T</A> is a set of involutions that generate <A>G</A>;
 *<A>T</A> is closed under conjugation by <A>G</A>;
 *the order of the product of two elements of <A>T</A> is at most 6.

<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="input" Name="MAJORANA_RemoveDuplicateShapes" />
 <Description>
If an automorphism of the group <A>G</A> stabilises the set
 <A>T</A> then it induces an action on the pairs of elements of <A>T</A> and
 therefore on the shapes of a possible Majorana representation of the form
 <A>(G,T,V)</A>. If one shape is mapped to another in this way then their
 corresponding algebras must be isomorphic.
<P/>
 This function takes the record <A>input</A> as produced by the function
 <Ref Func="ShapesOfMajoranaRepresentation"/> or <Ref Func="ShapesOfMajoranaRepresentationAxiomM8"/>
 and replaces <A>input.shapes</A> with a list of shapes such that no two
 can be mapped to each other by an automorphism of <A>G</A>.
