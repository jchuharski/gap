  [33X[0;0YThis  is  the manual for the [5XGAP[105X package [5XLieAlgDB[105X, for accessing and working
  with several classifications of Lie algebras.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  the  mathematical  literature  many  classifications  of Lie algebras of
  various  types  have  been published (we refer to the bibliography for a few
  examples).  However,  working  with  these classifications from paper is not
  always   easy.  This  package  aims  at  making  a  few  classifications  of
  small-dimensional  Lie  algebras  that  have  appeared  in recent years more
  accessible.  For  each  classification  that  is  contained  in the package,
  functions  are provided that construct Lie algebras from that classification
  inside  [5XGAP[105X.  This allows the user to obtain easy access to the often rather
  complicated  data  contained  in a classification, and to directly interface
  the  Lie  algebras  to  the  functionality for Lie algebras which is already
  contained in the system.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe package contains the following classifications:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ynon-solvable  Lie  algebras over finite fields up to dimension 6 (from
        [Str]);[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ynilpotent  Lie  algebras of dimension up to 9 over [3XGF(2)[103X, of dimension
        up to 7 over [3XGF(3)[103X or [3XGF(5)[103X (from [Sch05]);[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ysimple  Lie  algebras  of  dimensions between 7 and 9 over [3XGF(2)[103X (from
        [VL06]);[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ythe  classification  of  solvable  Lie algebras of dimension at most 4
        (from [dG05]);[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ythe  classification  of  nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension at most 6
        (from [dG07] and [CdGS11]).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis   manual  is  structured  as  follows.  The  next  chapter  contains  a
  description of the main functions of the package. The third chapter contains
  descriptions  of  the classifications used in the package. Most of these are
  contained in published papers, but for the convenience of the user they have
  been added here.[133X
