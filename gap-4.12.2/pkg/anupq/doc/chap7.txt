  [33X[0;0YThe  ANU  [10Xpq[110X  program is written in C and the package can be installed under
  UNIX  and in environments similar to UNIX. In particular it is known to work
  on Linux and Mac OS X, and also on Windows equipped with cygwin.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  current  version of the [5XANUPQ[105X package requires [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.9, and version 1.2
  of  the  [5XAutPGrp[105X  package.  However, we recommend using at least [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.6 and
  [5XAutPGrp[105XÂ 1.5.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  install  the  [5XANUPQ[105X  package,  move  the  file [10Xanupq-[3XXXX[103X[10X.tar.gz[110X for some
  version  number  [3XXXX[103X  into  the  [10Xpkg[110X  directory in which you plan to install
  [5XANUPQ[105X.  Usually,  this  will  be  the directory [10Xpkg[110X in the hierarchy of your
  version  of  [5XGAP[105X;  it  is  however  also  possible to keep an additional [10Xpkg[110X
  directory  in  your  private directories. The only essential difference with
  installing  [5XANUPQ[105X  in a [10Xpkg[110X directory different to the [5XGAP[105X home directory is
  that  one  must start [5XGAP[105X with the [10X-l[110X switch (see SectionÂ [14XReference: Command
  Line Options[114X), e.g.Â if your private [10Xpkg[110X directory is a subdirectory of [10Xmygap[110X
  in your home directory you might type:[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4Xgap -l ";myhomedir/mygap"[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0Ywhere [3Xmyhomedir[103X is the path to your home directory, which may be replaced by
  a  tilde.  The  empty  path before the semicolon is filled in by the default
  path of the [5XGAP[105X home directory.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThen, in your chosen [10Xpkg[110X directory, unpack [10Xanupq-[3XXXX[103X[10X.tar.gz[110X by[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4Xtar xf anupq-<XXX>.tar.gz[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YChange to the newly created [10Xanupq[110X directory. Now you need to call [10Xconfigure[110X.
  If you installed [5XANUPQ[105X into the main [10Xpkg[110X directory, call[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4X./configure[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf   you   installed  ANUPQ  in  another  directory  than  the  usual  'pkg'
  subdirectory, instead call[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4X./configure --with-gaproot=<path>[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0Ywhere [3Xpath[103X is the path to the [5XGAP[105X home directory. (You can also call[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4X./configure --help[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0Yfor further options.)[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhat  this  does is look for a file [10Xsysinfo.gap[110X in the root directory of [5XGAP[105X
  in  order  to  determine an architecture name for the subdirectory of [10Xbin[110X in
  which  to  put  the  compiled  [10Xpq[110X  binary.  This only makes sense if [5XGAP[105X was
  compiled  for  the  same  architecture that [10Xpq[110X will be. If you have a shared
  file  system  mounted  across  different  architectures, then you should run
  [10Xconfigure[110X  and  [10Xmake[110X  for  [5XANUPQ[105X  for  each  architecture  immediately after
  compiling [5XGAP[105X on the same architecture.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  you had to install the package in your own directory but wish to use the
  system [5XGAP[105X then you will need to find out what [3Xpath[103X is. To do this, start up
  [5XGAP[105X  and  find  out  what  [5XGAP[105X's  root path is from finding the value of the
  variable [10XGAPInfo.RootPaths[110X, e.g.[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Example  [32X[104X
    [4X[25Xgap>[125X [27XGAPInfo.RootPaths;[127X[104X
    [4X[28X[ "/usr/local/lib/gap4r4/" ][128X[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0Ywould tell you to use [10X/usr/local/lib/gap4r4[110X for [3Xpath[103X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [10Xconfigure[110X  command  will  fetch the architecture type for which [5XGAP[105X has
  been compiled last and create a [10XMakefile[110X. You can now simply call[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4Xmake[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0Yto compile the binary and to install it in the appropriate place.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe path of [5XGAP[105X (see [13XNote[113X below) used by the [10Xpq[110X binary (the value [10XGAP[110X is set
  to  in  the  [10Xmake[110X  command)  may  be  over-ridden by setting the environment
  variable  [10XANUPQ_GAP_EXEC[110X.  These  values  are  only  of interest when the [10Xpq[110X
  program  is run as a standalone; however, the [10XtestPq[110X script assumes you have
  set  one of these correctly (see SectionÂ [14X'[33X[0;0YTesting your ANUPQ installation[133X'[114X).
  When  the  [10Xpq[110X  program  is  started  from  [5XGAP[105X  communication  occurs via an
  iostream,  so that the [10Xpq[110X binary does not actually need to know a valid path
  for [5XGAP[105X is this case.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[13XNote.[113X  By  [21Xpath  of  [5XGAP[105X[121X  we mean the path of the command used to invoke [5XGAP[105X
  (which  should  be  a  script,  e.g.  the [10Xgap.sh[110X script generated in the [10Xbin[110X
  directory  for the version of [5XGAP[105X when [5XGAP[105X was compiled). The usual strategy
  is   to   copy   the   [10Xgap.sh[110X   script   to   a   standard   location,  e.g.
  [10X/usr/local/bin/gap[110X.  It  is  a  mistake to copy the [5XGAP[105X executable [10Xgap[110X (in a
  directory  with name of form [10Xbin/[3Xcompile-platform[103X[10X[110X) to the standard location,
  since  direct  invocation  of the executable results in [5XGAP[105X starting without
  being able to find its own library (a fatal error).[133X

  [33X[0;0YNow  it is time to test the installation. After doing [10Xconfigure[110X and [10Xmake[110X you
  will  have  a  [10XtestPq[110X  script.  The  script assumes that, if the environment
  variable  [10XANUPQ_GAP_EXEC[110X  is set, it is a correct path for [5XGAP[105X, or otherwise
  that  the  [10Xmake[110X  call that compiled the [10Xpq[110X program set [10XGAP[110X to a correct path
  for  [5XGAP[105X  (see  SectionÂ [14X'[33X[0;0YRunning  the  pq  program as a standalone[133X'[114X for more
  details). To run the tests, just type:[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4X./testPq[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YSome  of  the  tests  the  script  runs take a while. Please be patient. The
  script  checks  that  you not only have a correct [5XGAP[105X (at least version 4.4)
  installation  that  includes the [5XAutPGrp[105X package, but that the [5XANUPQ[105X package
  and  its  [10Xpq[110X  binary  interact  correctly. You should see something like the
  following output:[133X

  [1X7.2 [33X[0;0YRunning the pq program as a standalone[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhen the [10Xpq[110X program is run as a standalone it sometimes needs to call [5XGAP[105X to
  compute  stabilisers of subgroups; in doing so, it first checks the value of
  the environment variable [10XANUPQ_GAP_EXEC[110X, and uses that, if set, or otherwise
  the  value  of  [10XGAP[110X  it  was  compiled with, as the path for [5XGAP[105X. If you ran
  [10XtestPq[110X  (see SectionÂ [14X'[33X[0;0YTesting your ANUPQ installation[133X'[114X) and you got both [5XGAP[105X
  is  [10XOK[110X and the link between the [10Xpq[110X binary and [5XGAP[105X is [10XOK[110X, you should be fine.
  Otherwise heed the recommendations of the error messages you get and run the
  [10XtestPq[110X until all tests are passed.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  is  especially  important that the [5XGAP[105X, whose path you gave, should know
  where to find the [5XANUPQ[105X and [5XAutPGrp[105X packages. To ensure this the path should
  be  to  a shell script that invokes [5XGAP[105X. If you needed to install the needed
  packages  in  your  own  directory  (because,  say,  you  are  not  a system
  administrator)  then  you  should create your own shell script that runs [5XGAP[105X
  with  a  correct  setting  of  the [10X-l[110X option and set the path used by the [10Xpq[110X
  binary  to the path of that script. To create the script that runs [5XGAP[105X it is
  easiest  to  copy  the  system  one and edit it, e.g. start by executing the
  following  UNIX  commands  (skip  the  second step if you already have a [10Xbin[110X
  directory; [10Xyou@unix>[110X is your UNIX prompt):[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4Xyou@unix> cd[104X
    [4Xyou@unix> mkdir bin[104X
    [4Xyou@unix> cd bin[104X
    [4Xyou@unix> which gap[104X
    [4X/usr/local/bin/gap[104X
    [4Xyou@unix> cp /usr/local/bin/gap mygap[104X
    [4Xyou@unix> chmod +x mygap[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YAt  the  second-last  step  use  the  path of [5XGAP[105X returned by [10Xwhich gap[110X. Now
  hopefully  you  will  have  a copy of the script that runs the system [5XGAP[105X in
  [10Xmygap[110X. Now use your favourite editor to edit the [10X-l[110X part of the last line of
  [10Xmygap[110X which should initially look something like:[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4Xexec $GAP_DIR/bin/$GAP_PRG -m $GAP_MEM -o 970m -l $GAP_DIR $*[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0Yso  that  it  becomes  (the  tilde  is  a  UNIX  abbreviation  for your home
  directory):[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4Xexec $GAP_DIR/bin/$GAP_PRG -m $GAP_MEM -o 970m -l "$GAP_DIR;~/gapstuff" $*[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0Yassuming  that your personal [5XGAP[105X [10Xpkg[110X directory is a subdirectory of [10Xgapstuff[110X
  in your home directory. Finally, to let the [10Xpq[110X program know where [5XGAP[105X is and
  also  know  where  your  [10Xpkg[110X  directory  is  that  contains  [5XANUPQ[105X,  set the
  environment  variable [10XANUPQ_GAP_EXEC[110X to the complete (i.e. absolute) path of
  your [10Xmygap[110X script (do not use the tilde abbreviation).[133X
