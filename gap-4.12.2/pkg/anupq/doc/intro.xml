<Index>ANUPQ</Index>
The &GAP;&nbsp;4 package &ANUPQ; provides an interface to the ANU <C>pq</C> C
progam written by Eamonn O'Brien, making the functionality of the C
program available to &GAP;. Henceforth, we shall refer to the &ANUPQ;
package when referring to the &GAP; interface, and to the ANU <C>pq</C>
program or just <C>pq</C> when referring to that C program.
<P/>

The <C>pq</C> program consists of implementations of the following algorithms:
<P/>

<Enum>
<Item>
A <E><M>p</M>-quotient algorithm</E> to compute pc-presentations for <M>p</M>-factor
groups of finitely presented groups.
<P/>
<!-- The algorithm implemented here is based on that described by Newman and -->
<!-- O'Brien <Cite Key="NO96"/>, Havas and Newman&nbsp;<Cite Key="HN80"/>, and papers referred to -->
<!-- there. Another description of the algorithm is given by Vaughan-Lee -->
<!-- (see&nbsp;<Cite Key="VL90a"/>, <Cite Key="VL90b"/>). A FORTRAN implementation of this -->
<!-- algorithm was programmed by Alford and Havas. The basic data structures -->
<!-- of that implementation are retained. -->
</Item>

<Item>
 A <E><M>p</M>-group generation algorithm</E> to generate pc presentations of groups
of prime power order.
<P/>
<!-- The algorithm implemented here is based on the algorithms described by -->
<!-- Newman&nbsp;<Cite Key="New77"/> and O'Brien&nbsp;<Cite Key="OBr90"/>. A FORTRAN implementation of -->
<!-- this algorithm was developed earlier by Newman and O'Brien. -->
</Item>

<Item>
A <E>standard presentation algorithm</E> used to compute a canonical
pc-presentation of a <M>p</M>-group.
<P/>
<!-- The algorithm implemented here is described in&nbsp;<Cite Key="OBr94"/>. -->
</Item>

<Item>
 An algorithm which can be used to compute the <E>automorphism group</E> of a
<M>p</M>-group.
<P/>

This part of the <C>pq</C> program is not accessible through the &ANUPQ;
package. Instead, users are advised to consider the &GAP;&nbsp;4 package
&AutPGrp; by Bettina Eick and Eamonn O'Brien, which implements a better
algorithm in &GAP; for the computation of automorphism groups of
<M>p</M>-groups.
<!-- The algorithm implemented here is described in&nbsp;<Cite Key="OBr94"/>. -->
</Item>

</Enum>

<!-- Further background may be found in&nbsp;<Cite Key="OBr95"/>, <Cite Key="VL84"/> -->
<!-- and&nbsp;<Cite Key="NNN98"/>. -->

The current version of the &ANUPQ; package requires &GAP;&nbsp;4.5, and
version 1.5 of the &AutPGrp; package. All code that made the package
compatible with earlier versions of &GAP; has been removed.
If you must use an older &GAP; version and cannot upgrade, then you may
try using an older &ANUPQ; version. However, you should not use versions
of the &ANUPQ; package older than 2.2, since they are known to have bugs.

<Heading>How to read this manual</Heading>

It is not expected that readers of this manual will read it in a linear
fashion from cover to cover; some sections contain material that is far
too technical to be absorbed on a first reading.
<P/>

Firstly, installers of the &ANUPQ; package will need to read
Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Installing-ANUPQ" Style="Text"/>, if they have not already gleaned
these details from the <C>README</C> file.
<P/>

Once the &ANUPQ; package is installed, users of the &ANUPQ; package
will benefit most by first reading Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Mathematical Background and Terminology" Style="Text"/>, which gives a brief description of the background and
terminology used (this chapter also cites a number of references for
further reading), and the introduction of Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Infrastructure" Style="Text"/> (skip
the remainder of the chapter on a first reading).
<P/>

Then the user/reader should pursue
Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="non-interact" Style="Text"/>
in detail, delving into Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="ANUPQ Options" Style="Text"/> as necessary
for the options of the functions that are described. The user will become
best acquainted with the &ANUPQ; package by trying the examples. This
chapter describes the non-interactive functions of the &ANUPQ; package,
i.e.&nbsp;<Q>one-shot</Q> functions that invoke the <C>pq</C> program in such a way
that once &GAP; has got what it needs, the <C>pq</C> is allowed to exit. It
is expected that most of the time, users will only need these functions.
<P/>

Advanced users will want to explore Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Interactive ANUPQ functions" Style="Text"/>
which describes all the interactive functions of the &ANUPQ; package;
these are functions that extract information via a dialogue with a
running <C>pq</C> process. Occasionally, a user needs the <Q>next step</Q>; the
functions provided in this chapter make use of data from previous steps
retained by the <C>pq</C> program, thus allowing the user to interact with the
<C>pq</C> program like one can when one uses the <C>pq</C> program as a stand-alone
(see&nbsp;<C>guide.dvi</C> in the <C>standalone-doc</C> directory).
<P/>

After having read Chapters&nbsp;<Ref Chap="non-interact" Style="Text"/>
and&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Interactive ANUPQ functions" Style="Text"/>, cross-references will have taken the
reader into Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="ANUPQ Options" Style="Text"/>; by this stage, the reader need only
read the introduction of Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="ANUPQ Options" Style="Text"/>.
<P/>

After the reader has developed some facility with the &ANUPQ; package,
she should explore the examples described in Appendix&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Examples" Style="Text"/>.
<P/>

If you run into trouble using the &ANUPQ; functions, some
troubleshooting hints are given in
Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Hints and Warnings regarding the use of Options" Style="Text"/>.
If the troubleshooting hints don't help,
Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Authors and Acknowledgements" Style="Text"/> below, gives contact details for
the authors of the components of the &ANUPQ; package.

The C implementation of the ANU <C>pq</C> standalone was developed by Eamonn O'Brien.
<P/>

An interactive interface using iostreams was developed with the
assistance of Werner Nickel by Greg Gamble.
<P/>

The &GAP; 4 version of this package was adapted from the &GAP; 3
version by Werner Nickel.
<P/>

A new co-maintainer, Max Horn, joined the team in November, 2011.
<P/>

The authors would like to thank Joachim Neub√ºser for his
careful proof-reading and advice, and for formulating
Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Mathematical Background and Terminology" Style="Text"/>.
<P/>

We would also like to thank Bettina Eick who by her testing and provision
of examples helped us to eliminate a number of bugs and who provided a
number of valuable suggestions for extensions of the package beyond the
&GAP;&nbsp;3 capabilities. 
<P/>

<Index>bug reports</Index>
If you find a bug, the last section of &ANUPQ;'s <C>README</C> describes the
information we need and where to send us a bug report; please take the
time to read this (i.e.&nbsp;help us to help you).
