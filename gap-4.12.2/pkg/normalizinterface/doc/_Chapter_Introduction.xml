Normaliz <Cite Key="normaliz" /> is a software for computations with rational cones and affine
monoids. It pursues two main computational goals: finding the Hilbert
basis, a minimal generating system of the monoid of lattice points of a
cone; and counting elements degree-wise in a generating function, the
Hilbert series.
As a recent extension, Normaliz can handle unbounded polyhedra. The
Hilbert basis computation can be considered as solving a linear
diophantine system of inhomogeneous equations, inequalities and
congruences.  <P/>

This package encapsulates a libnormaliz cone and gives access to it in the
&GAP; environment. In this way &GAP; can be used as interactive interface to
libnormaliz.  <P/>
