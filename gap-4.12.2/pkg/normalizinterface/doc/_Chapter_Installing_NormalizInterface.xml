<P/>
NormalizInterface supports GAP 4.9 or later, and Normaliz 3.5.4 or later.
<P/>
<P/>
For technical reasons, installing and using NormalizInterface requires
that your version of GAP is compiled in a special way. Specifically, GAP
must be compiled against the exact same version of the GMP library as
Normaliz. By default, GAP compiles its own version of GMP; however, we
cannot use that, as it lacks C++ support, which is required by Normaliz.
<P/>
<P/>
Thus as the very first step, please install a version of GMP in your
system. On most Linux and BSD distributions, there should be a GMP
package available with your system's package manager. On Mac OS X, you
can install GMP via Fink, MacPorts or Homebrew.
<P/>
<P/>
Next, make sure your GAP installation is compiled against the system
wide GMP installation. To do so, switch to the GAP root directory, and
enter the following commands:
<P/>
<P/>
<Listing><![CDATA[
make clean
./configure --with-gmp=PATH/TO/YOUR/GMP
make
]]></Listing>
<P/>
Next you need to compile a recent version of Normaliz. This requires the
presence of several further system software packages, which you install
via your system's package manager. At least the following are required:
<P/>
<P/>
<List>
<Item>
curl OR wget for downloading the source code
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
Once you have installed these, you can build Normaliz by using
the <Code>prerequisites.sh</Code> script we provide. It takes a single,
optional parameter: the location of the GAP root directory.
<P/>
<P/>
<Listing><![CDATA[
./prerequisites.sh GAPDIR
]]></Listing>
<P/>
Once it completed successfully, you can then build NormalizInterface
like this:
<P/>
<P/>
<Listing><![CDATA[
./configure --with-gaproot=GAPDIR
make
]]></Listing>
