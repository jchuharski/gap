  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YInstallation and Loading[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YLike other [5XGAP[105X packages, you download and unpack this package into [5XGAP[105X's [9Xpkg[109X
  directory.  For  example,  if  you  were  running [5XGAP[105X on some machine with a
  Unix-based  operating  system  and  [5XGAP[105X  were  installed  in  the  directory
  [9X/usr/local/gap[109X then you would do the following to install [5XCRIME[105X.[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Example  [32X[104X

  [33X[0;0YIn  this  situation,  users  would  load  the  package  with the [9XLoadPackage[109X
  command.[133X

  [33X[0;0YUsers  not  having root access, using someone else's computer, or having bad
  relationships  with  their network administrators, could install the package
  into  their  home  directories or into some other writable directory such as
  [9X/tmp[109X and load the package as follows.[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Example  [32X[104X

  [33X[0;0YEven  simpler,  users can simply install the package in the [9X~/.gap[109X directory
  as follows.[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Example  [32X[104X

  [33X[0;0YFinally,  it  would  be a good idea to run the test file to confirm that all
  the functions work properly. This can be accomplished as follows.[133X

  [33X[0;0YYou  can  count yourself lucky if [5XGAP[105X doesn't complain about anything. There
  is  also  a  longer  running  test  file  for  those  having ample free time
  described in Appendix [14XB[114X.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YFor Further Information[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  file  [9Xdoc/example.*[109X  contains the step-by-step [5XCRIME[105X calculation of the
  cohomology ring of the quaternion group. The file [9Xdoc/explanation.*[109X contains
  a  theoretical  description  of  how  the  package  calculates  the  various
  cohomology products. Users wishing to read the source code can print all the
  programs  in the [9Xgap[109X directory with the program [9Xgap/print.pl[109X which should be
  executed in the [9Xgap[109X directory.[133X
