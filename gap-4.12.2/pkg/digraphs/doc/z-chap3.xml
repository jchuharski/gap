       This operator returns <K>true</K> if one of the following holds:

         <Item>
           The number <M>n_1</M> of vertices in <A>digraph1</A> is less than

           <C>DigraphEdges(<A>digraph2</A>)</C> after having both of these sets
           have been sorted with respect to the lexicographical order.
