  <Abstract>
    &Kan; is a &GAP; package originally implemented in 1996 using the &GAP; 3 language, to compute induced actions of categories, when the first author was studying for a Ph.D. in Bangor.
<P/>
This reduced version only provides functions for the computation of normal forms of representatives of double cosets of finitely presented groups.
<P/>
&Kan; became an accepted &GAP; package in May 2015.
<P/>
Bug reports, suggestions and comments are, of course, welcome.
Please contact the last author at <Email>c.d.wensley@bangor.ac.uk</Email> or submit an issue at the GitHub repository <URL>https://github.com/gap-packages/kan/issues/</URL>.
