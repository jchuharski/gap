  <Abstract>
    
                The <Package>DifSets</Package> Package implements an algorithm
                for enumerating all difference sets up to equivalence in an
                arbitrary finite group. The algorithm functions by finding
                difference sums, which are potential images of difference sets
                in quotient groups of the original group, and searching their
                preimages. In this way, the search space can be dramatically
                decreased, and searches of groups of relatively large order
                (such as order 64 or order 96) can be completed.
