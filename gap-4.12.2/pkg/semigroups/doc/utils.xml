     <Description>
       This global variable is a record whose components contain the default
       values of certain options for semigroups.  A description of these
       options is given above in Section
       <Ref Sect = "Options when creating semigroups"/>.
       <P/>

       The value of <C>SEMIGROUPS.DefaultOptionsRec</C> is defined in the file

    <Description>
      This function should be called with no argument to comprehensively test
      that &SEMIGROUPS; is working correctly. These tests should take no more
      than a few minutes to complete.  To quickly test that &SEMIGROUPS; is
      installed correctly use <Ref Func = "SemigroupsTestInstall"/>.<P/>

      Each test file is run twice, once when the methods for 
      <Ref Filt="IsActingSemigroup"/> are enabled and once when they are
      disabled.

    <Description>
      This function should be called with no argument to test your installation
      of &SEMIGROUPS; is working correctly. These tests should take no more
      than a few seconds to complete.  To more comprehensively test
      that &SEMIGROUPS; is installed correctly use

    <Returns>A list indicating which tests passed and failed and the time take
      to run each file.</Returns>
    <Description>
      This function should be called with no argument to run some long-running
      tests, which could be used to benchmark &SEMIGROUPS; or test your
      hardware. These tests should take no more than around half an hour to
      complete.  To quickly test that &SEMIGROUPS; is installed correctly use
      <Ref Func = "SemigroupsTestInstall"/>, or to test all aspects of the
      package use <Ref Func = "SemigroupsTestStandard"/>.<P/>

      Each test file is run twice, once when the methods for semigroups
      satisfying <Ref Filt="IsActingSemigroup"/> are enabled and once when they
      are disabled.

    <Returns><K>true</K> or <K>false</K>.</Returns>
    <Description>
      This function should be called with no argument to compile the
      &SEMIGROUPS; package's documentation, run the standard suite of tests, and
      run all the examples from the documentation to ensure that their output is
      correct.  The value returned is <K>true</K> if all the tests succeed, and
      <K>false</K> otherwise.  The whole process should take no more than a few
      minutes. <P/>

    <Description>
    <C>InfoSemigroups</C> is the info class of the &SEMIGROUPS; package.  The
    info level is initially set to 0 and no info messages are displayed.  To
    increase the amount of information displayed during a computation increase
    the info level to 2 or 3. To stop all info messages from being displayed,
    set the info level to 0.  See also
