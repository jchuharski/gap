  <Abstract>
    &IdRel; is a &GAP; package originally implemented in 1999, using the &GAP; 3 language, when the first author was studying for a Ph.D. in Bangor.
<P/>
This package is designed to compute a minimal set of generators for the module of the identities among relators of a group presentation.
It does this using
<List>
<Item>
rewriting and logged rewriting: a self-contained implementation of the Knuth-Bendix process using the monoid presentation associated to the group presentation;
</Item>
<Item>
monoid polynomials: an implementation of the monoid ring;
</Item>
<Item>
module polynomials: an implementation of the right module over this monoid generated by the relators.
</Item>
<Item>
Y-sequences: used as a <E>rewriting</E> way of representing elements of a free crossed module (products of conjugates of group relators and inverse relators).
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
&idrel; became an accepted &GAP; package in May 2015.
<P/>
Bug reports, suggestions and comments are, of course, welcome.
