  [33X[0;0YWhen  this package is being used in a Jupyter Notebook, it has the following
  limitations.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIf this package is used in [10XPlotDisplayMethod_Jupyter[110X mode in a Jupyter
        notebook,  and  visualizations  are  created by this package, then the
        notebook  is  saved  and  later  reloaded, the visualizations will not
        persist.  They  will  be  replaced by an error message instructing the
        user  to  re-run  the cell that created the visualization. You can get
        around       this       by      setting      [10XPlotDisplayMethod      :=
        PlotDisplayMethod_JupyterSimple[110X,  but  this increases the size of your
        notebook  by embedding all the JavaScript needed by the visualizations
        in  the  notebook  itself.  Note that [10XPlotDisplayMethod_Jupyter[110X is the
        default mode in the notebook.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  [10Xnbconvert[110X  tool,  which converts [11X.ipynb[111X files into other formats,
        will  not  include  the  visualizations,  because  [10Xnbconvert[110X  is not a
        browser  that  can  evaluate  the  JavaScript  code that generates the
        visualizations.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YWhen  using  the  [10XPlotDisplayMethod_Jupyter[110X  mode, most visualizations
        load  a  JavaScript  library from a CDN, which thus requires a working
        Internet connection to function.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhen  it  is  being  used  from  the  command  line,  it  has  the following
  limitations.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  JavaScript  function  [10XrunGAP[110X  introduced  in  Section  [14X4.3[114X is not
        available.  That  function depends upon the ability to ask the Jupyter
        Kernel to run [5XGAP[105X code, and thus when there is no Jupyter Kernel, that
        function cannot work.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YEach    new    call   to   [2XPlot[102X   ([14X7.1-1[114X),   [2XPlotGraph[102X   ([14X7.1-3[114X),   or
        [2XCreateVisualization[102X  ([14X7.2-5[114X) will be stored in a new temporary file on
        the  user's  filesystem  and  thus shown in a new tab or window in the
        user's  browser.  That  is,  one does not iteratively improve a single
        visualization,  but  is  forced  to  open a new window or tab for each
        call.[133X
