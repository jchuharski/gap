<P/>
 When this package is being used in a Jupyter Notebook, it has the
 following limitations.
<P/>
<List>
<Item>
If this package is used in <Code>PlotDisplayMethod_Jupyter</Code>
    mode in a Jupyter notebook, and visualizations are created by this
    package, then the notebook is saved and later reloaded, the
    visualizations will not persist.  They will be replaced by an error
    message instructing the user to re-run the cell that created the
    visualization.  You can get around this by setting
    <Code>PlotDisplayMethod := PlotDisplayMethod_JupyterSimple</Code>,
    but this increases the size of your notebook by embedding all the
    JavaScript needed by the visualizations in the notebook itself.
    Note that <Code>PlotDisplayMethod_Jupyter</Code> is the default
    mode in the notebook.
</Item>
<Item>
The <Code>nbconvert</Code> tool, which converts <File>.ipynb</File>
    files into other formats, will not include the visualizations, because
    <Code>nbconvert</Code> is not a browser that can evaluate the
    JavaScript code that generates the visualizations.
</Item>
<Item>
When using the <Code>PlotDisplayMethod_Jupyter</Code> mode, most
    visualizations load a JavaScript library from a CDN, which thus
    requires a working Internet connection to function.
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
 When it is being used from the command line, it has the following
 limitations.
<P/>
<List>
<Item>
The JavaScript function <Code>runGAP</Code> introduced in Section
    <Ref Sect="Section_plainhtml"/> is not available.  That function
    depends upon the ability to ask the Jupyter Kernel to run &GAP; code,
    and thus when there is no Jupyter Kernel, that function cannot work.
</Item>
<Item>
Each new call to <Ref Func="Plot"/>, <Ref Func="PlotGraph"/>, or
    <Ref Func="CreateVisualization"/> will be stored in a new temporary
    file on the user's filesystem and thus shown in a new tab or window
    in the user's browser.  That is, one does not iteratively improve a
    single visualization, but is forced to open a new window or tab for
    each call.
