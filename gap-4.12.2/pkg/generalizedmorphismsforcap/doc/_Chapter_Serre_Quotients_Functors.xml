 The operations in this chapter construct conversion functors between two
 Serre quotients of different standards.
 Please note that all the operations DO NOT CARE if the Serre quotients
 are modeling the same category, they only care wether the categories are
 based upon the same underlying honest category.

 <Description>
  Given two Serre quotients <A>A</A> and <A>B</A> of the same category <A>C</A> by equivalent functions, this operation
  returns the conversion functor between the two categories. Please note that this function does not check the
  quotients in any sense, i.e., wether the functions are equivalent.
