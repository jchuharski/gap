  This is an implementation of a convenience object for Serre quotients.
  The Subcategory implemented in this file is not a CAP category at all,
  but only a handler for the serre quotient construction.
  It does not contain objects or anything useful, it is just a wrapper for the
  function the Serre quotient is based upon.
