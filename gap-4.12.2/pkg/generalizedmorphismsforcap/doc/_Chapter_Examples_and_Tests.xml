<Heading>Intersection of Nodal Curve and Cusp</Heading>

 We are going to intersect the nodal curve 
 <Math>f = y^2 - x^2(x+1)</Math>
 and the cusp <Math>g = (x+y)^2 - (y-x)^3</Math>.
 The two curves are arranged in a way such that they intersect
 at <Math>(0,0)</Math> with intersection number as high as possible.
 We are going to compute this intersection number
 using the definition of the intersection number as the
 length of the module <Math>R/(f,g)</Math> localized at <Math>(0,0)</Math>.
 In order to model modules over the localization of <Math>Q[x,y]</Math> at
 <Math>(0,0)</Math>, we use a suitable Serre quotient category.
