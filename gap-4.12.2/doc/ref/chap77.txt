  [33X[0;0YIn  general  we try to keep [5XGAP[105XÂ 4 compatible with former releases as much as
  possible.  Nevertheless,  from  time  to time it seems appropriate to remove
  some  commands  or  to change the names of some commands or variables. There
  are  various  reasons  for  that:  Some  functionality  was improved and got
  another  (hopefully better) interface, names turned out to be too special or
  too  general  for  the  underlying  functionality,  or names are found to be
  unintuitive or inconsistent with other names.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  this  chapter  we  collect such old names while pointing to the sections
  which  explain  how to substitute them. Usually, old names will be available
  for  several  releases;  they may be removed when they don't seem to be used
  any more.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YInformation  about  obsolete  names  is  printed  by  [2XInfo[102X ([14X7.4-6[114X) using the
  [2XInfoObsolete[102X ([14X77.4-1[114X) Info class. By default [2XInfoObsolete[102X ([14X77.4-1[114X) is set to
  1. Newly obsoleted identifiers should at first be outputted at info level 2.
  Once  they have been removed from all packages, they should then be moved to
  info  level  1,  so they are visible to normal users, for at least one major
  release before being removed.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  functions [10XDeclareObsoleteSynonym[110X and [10XDeclareObsoleteSynonymAttr[110X take an
  optional  final  parameter,  specifying  the  info  level at which the given
  obsolete symbol should be reported. It defaults to 2 and 1, respectively.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe obsolete [5XGAP[105X code is collected in two library files, [11Xlib/obsolete.gd[111X and
  [11Xlib/obsolete.gi[111X.  By  default,  these files are read when [5XGAP[105X is started. It
  may be useful to omit reading these files, for example in order to make sure
  that  one's  own [5XGAP[105X code does not rely on the obsolete variables. For that,
  one  can  use  the  [10X-O[110X  command  line  option (see [14X3.1[114X) or set the component
  [10XReadObsolete[110X  in  the  file [11Xgap.ini[111X to [9Xfalse[109X (see [14X3.2[114X). Note that [10X-O[110X command
  line option overrides [10XReadObsolete[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y(Note  that  the  condition  whether the library files with the obsolete [5XGAP[105X
  code  shall  be  read  has changed. In [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.3 and 4.4, the global variables
  [10XGAP_OBSOLESCENT[110X  and  [10XGAPInfo.ReadObsolete[110X  â€“to  be set in the user's [11X.gaprc[111X

  [33X[0;0YThe concept of a group action is sometimes referred to as a [21Xgroup operation[121X.
  In  [5XGAP[105XÂ 3  as well as in older versions of [5XGAP[105XÂ 4 the term [10XOperation[110X was used
  instead  of  [10XAction[110X.  We decided to change the names to avoid confusion with
  the term [21Xoperation[121X as in [2XDeclareOperation[102X ([14X78.1-5[114X) and [21Xoperations for Xyz[121X.[133X

  [33X[0;0YWith  [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.4  the  package  interface  was  changed. Thereby some functions
  became obsolete and the names of some others were made more consistent.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe    following   functions   are   no   longer   needed:   [10XDeclarePackage[110X,

  [33X[0;0YFurthermore,  the  global  variable  [10XPACKAGES_VERSIONS[110X  is no longer needed,
  since  this  information is now contained in the [10XGAPInfo.PackagesInfo[110X record
  (see  [14X3.5-1[114X).  The global variable [10XRevisions[110X is also no longer needed, since

  [33X[0;0YFormer  versions  of  [5XGAP[105XÂ 4  documented  several functions for computing the
  Smith  or  Hermite  normal form of integer matrices. Some of them were never
  implemented  and  it was unclear which commands to use. The functionality of
  all  of these commands is now available with [2XNormalFormIntMat[102X ([14X25.2-9[114X) and a
  few interface functions.[133X
  
  
  [1X77.4 [33X[0;0YMiscellaneous Name Changes or Removed Names[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  former  releases of [5XGAP[105XÂ 4 there were some global variable names bound to
  general  information  about  the  running [5XGAP[105X, such as path names or command
  line options. Although they were not officially documented they were used by
  several  users  and in some packages. We mention here [10XBANNER[110X and [10XQUIET[110X. This
  type of information is now collected in the global record [2XGAPInfo[102X ([14X3.5-1[114X).[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe  operation  [10XPositionFirstComponent[110X has been deprecated in GAP 4.8 due to
  issues  with  its  documentation  and implementation, and was removed in GAP
  4.10.    Instead    of   [10XPositionFirstComponent(list,obj)[110X,   you   may   use
  [10XPositionSorted(list,[obj])[110X   or   [10XPositionProperty(list,x->x[1]=obj)[110X   as  a
  replacement,  depending on your specific use case. The five argument version
  of  the operation [10XMultRowVector[110X has been deprecated in GAP 4.10 since it was
  unused and only available for coefficient lists. Note that [10XMultRowVector[110X was
  also renamed to [10XMultVectorLeft[110X. The function [10XTemporaryGlobalVarName[110X has been
  deprecated  in  GAP 4.11. Code using it typically can be restructured to not
  need it, e.g. by using [2XEvalString[102X ([14X27.9-5[114X).[133X
  
  [1X77.4-1 InfoObsolete[101X
  
  [33X[1;0Y[29X[2XInfoObsolete[102X [32X info class[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Yis  an  info class to display warnings when an obsolete variable is used. By
  default,  the  info  level  for this class is set to 1, which will only show
  variables which will be removed in the next major version of GAP. Setting it
  to  2  will  trigger  further warnings, for variables which have alternative
  names,  or  may  be removed in future. This class can be set to 0 to disable
  all obsolete warnings.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  check  that  the [5XGAP[105X code does not use any obsolete variables at parsing
  time, and not at a runtime, use the [10X-O[110X command line option, see [14X3.1[114X.[133X
  
  
  [1X77.5 [33X[0;0YThe former .gaprc file[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YUp to [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.4, a file [11X.gaprc[111X in the user's home directory (if available, and
  [5XGAP[105X  was  started  without [10X-r[110X option) was read automatically during startup,
  early enough for influencing the autoloading of packages and late enough for
  being  allowed  to  execute  any [5XGAP[105X code. On Windows machines this file was
  called [11Xgap.rc[111X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.5 the startup mechanism has changed, see [14X3.2[114X for details. These new
  configuration files are now contained in a directory [10XGAPInfo.UserGapRoot[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  the  sake  of  partial  backwards  compatibility,  also the former file
  [11X~/.gaprc[111X  is still supported for such initializations, but this file is read
  only  if  the directory [10XGAPInfo.UserGapRoot[110X does not exist. In that case the
  [11X~/.gaprc[111X  is  read  at the same time as [11Xgaprc[111X would be read, i.Â e., too late
  for influencing the startup of [5XGAP[105X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs before, the command line option [10X-r[110X disables reading [11X~/.gaprc[111X, see [14X3.1[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  migrate from the old setup to the new one introduced with [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.5, first
  have  a  look  at the function [2XWriteGapIniFile[102X ([14X3.2-3[114X). Many users will find
  that  all  or  most of what was set in the old [11X~/.gaprc[111X file can now be done
  via  the  user  preferences  in  a  [11Xgap.ini[111X  file.  If  you had code for new
  functions  or  abbreviations  in  your old [11X~/.gaprc[111X file or you were reading
  additional  files,  then  move this into the file [11Xgaprc[111X (without the leading
  dot,   same   name   for   all   operating   systems)   in   the   directory
  [10XGAPInfo.UserGapRoot[110X.[133X

  [33X[0;0YUntil  Version  4.8  of  [5XGAP[105X  there  was  inconsistent  use of the following
  properties   of  semigroups:  [10XIsGroupAsSemigroup[110X,  [10XIsMonoidAsSemigroup[110X,  and
  [10XIsSemilatticeAsSemigroup[110X.  [10XIsGroupAsSemigroup[110X  was  true for semigroups that
  mathematically  defined  a group, and for semigroups in the category [2XIsGroup[102X
  ([14X39.2-7[114X);  [10XIsMonoidAsSemigroup[110X  was  true for semigroups that mathematically
  defined  monoids,  but did not belong to the category [2XIsMonoid[102X ([14X51.2-1[114X); and
  [10XIsSemilatticeAsSemigroup[110X  was  simply  a property of semigroups, there is no
  category [10XIsSemilattice[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFrom Version 4.8 onwards, [10XIsMonoidAsSemigroup[110X returns [9Xtrue[109X for semigroups in
  the  category [2XIsMonoid[102X ([14X51.2-1[114X), and [10XIsSemilatticeAsSemigroup[110X has been moved
  to   the   [5XSemigroups[105X   under   the   new  name  [2XIsSemilattice[102X  ([14XSemigroups:
